# MeasuringObjects #Computer Vision

Exploring more computer vision and looked into Object sizes. 

The image used was the first thing I could think of which was inspired by Adrian

One thing I would change is part of the keyboard being in the image as the code tried to measure that as well.


Inspired by Adrian Rosebrock
